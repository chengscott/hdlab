# Lab1 1-bit and 4-bit ALU
Use combinational circuit to module a Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
- Lab1_1: use structural modeling to module a 1-bit ALU
- Lab1_2: use data flow modeling to module a 1-bit ALU
- Lab1_3: use behavioral modeling to module a 1-bit ALU
- Lab1_4: cascade 4 of 1-bit ALU to module 4-bit ALU

# Lab2 1-digit BCD Counter
Use sequential circuit to module a 1-digit BCD counter.
- Lab2_1: use combinational circuit to convert 1-digit BCD number to its next/previous BCD number
- Lab2_2: write a testbench to verify Lab2_1
- Lab2_3: use sequential circuit to design 1-digit BCD counter

# Lab3 Clock Divider and LED Controller
Module your design on FPGA demo board to control the LEDs as requirement
- Lab3_1: module a LED controller as requirement
- Lab3_2: rewrite Lab3_1 by adding a speed selection signal to speed up/down the light frequency

# Lab4 BCD and Pingpong Counters
Module a BCD/Pingpong counter on FPGA demo board to control the 7-segment display as requirement
- Lab4_1: module Lab2_2 to the FPGA on demo board
- Lab4_2: extend Lab4_1 from 1-digit to 2-digit
- Lab4_1: module a 2-digit pingpong counter to the FPGA on demo board

# Lab5 Ticket Machine
Module a controller for a ticket machine on FPGA demo board as requirement.

# Lab6 Ticket Machine(2)
Modify your lab5, there will be some specific key combinations of the keyboard that represent the buttons of a ticket machine on lab5.

# Lab7 Music Player
Design a music player that is able to play eight bars (measures) of "Chibi Maruko Chan - OP" and four bars (measures) of "Doraemon - OP".

# Lab8 VGA Display
Design a circuit for controlling the VGA display as requirement.
